This program pulls requests from the Yahoo Finance API to grab updated market prices. The user will be prompted to enter a stock ticker in which the function will return the ticker, current market price, and the current market time. From here, the data will be appended to local csv file. If that file does not exist already, an empty csv file will be created and initiated with the current data point.
